# fodland
map
Put all but serverstuff on workdrive in folder 'fodland'
make sure your \dz\structures\roads have the debinerized files in them (https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Using_Road_Tool_in_Terrain_Builder)
In terrainbuilder view Layers and refresh all layers 
In the Mapframe properties make sure the layers file is correct (P:\fodland\source\layers.cfg)
Tick Export satelite and surfarce and convert exported textures then click generate.
Then save and the file-export-WRP


As the Navmesh file is too large for Github you will have to run the navmesh generator and put the nm file in the nm folder .

Once you have moved the serverstuff out of this folder you can use the addon builder (I don't click on binerize)

Then sign the addon with DS Utils

You now have a map mod

Use the serverstuff in missions\dayzOffline.fodland

Also incuded is the source for meessing around with economy

Don't forget if you put any new buildings in or take any out Zombies will walk through walls till you have created a new Navmesh.
As this takes quite some time it's best to do it when you'v just about finished all your changes.

If You want to rename the map feel free to do so you obviously have to go into quite a few files to replace references but that's up to you.

If you do like it and get a server going it would be nice if you emailed me with server details so I can take a look (micromartin1963@gmail.com)
